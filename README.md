# 100-Days-of-code
This repository documents my 100 Days of Code Challenge in C Programming. Each day, I commit solutions, programs, and projects that cover fundamental to advanced concepts of C. The goal is to build a strong foundation in programming while improving problem-solving skills and consistency.
